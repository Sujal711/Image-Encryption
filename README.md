## 🚀 Features
✅ **AES-256 Encryption** - Uses a secure 256-bit key for encryption.  
✅ **IV-Based Security** - Each encryption uses a random Initialization Vector (IV).  
✅ **PKCS7 Padding** - Ensures encrypted data is a multiple of AES block size (16 bytes).  
✅ **End-to-End Encryption** - Encrypt and decrypt images without quality loss.  
✅ **User-Friendly Input** - Users can provide image paths dynamically.

## 📜 Requirements
Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed.

Make sure the image and the python program are in the same file. If not bring the image in the same file as the code or else make sure you use a proper image path
